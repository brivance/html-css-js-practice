    <h1>Links</h1>
    <p>This example is about links and <a href='images.html'>images</a>.</p>
    
    <p>This particular page is about links! There are three kinds of links:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Absolute links, like to
            <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML'>Mozilla
            Developer Network</a>, 
            which is a very good resource for webdevelopers. It gives links to URLs outside our website.
            </li>
        <li>Relative links, like to our <a href='misc/misc.html'>extras
            page</a>. This is relative to the page (aka file) you are currently in.
            </li>
        <li>Root-relative links, like to the <a href='/'>home page</a> of our website. 
            This is useful to get a link starting from the root (home page) path.</li>
    </ul>
